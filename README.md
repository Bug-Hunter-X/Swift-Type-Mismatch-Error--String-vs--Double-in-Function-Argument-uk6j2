This repository demonstrates a common Swift coding error: type mismatch in function parameters. The `bug.swift` file shows incorrect usage where a String is passed to a function expecting a Double.  `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected code.

This example highlights the importance of Swift's strong typing system and how to avoid common type-related errors during development. The solution emphasizes maintaining type consistency between function signatures and function calls.
